## 0.0.2 Roadmap 
- Basic global config section (logo, title)
- Decent Transaction receipt
- Navigation menu style

## Features needed for gym subscriptions
MUST:
- Full test:
    - CRUD associates
    - CRUD transactions
    - Edit/Attachments to subscriptions
- Add UI message that a membership renewal will be automatically added
- Polish Associate fields for membership tracking
- Proper receipt
- Membership card via mail how?
- Associates data import
SHOULD:
- Pre-registration member form (with privacy link and check)


## Feature brain dump
- Skipass warehouse management (people who paid multiple passes in advance)
- Reports (skipass list, transaction list, social competition list)
- Article management (with pricing and custom rule set, e.g. Same article attached to a minor would have a different price)
- How to add skipass to report (from either transaction list or the skipass warehouse)
- Report needs counts
- Pre-registration for new associates
- Card management (Google/Apple wallets or a mere PDF)
- Configuration management (e.g. Title, background image)
